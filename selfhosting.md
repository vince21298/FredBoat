# How to self-host FredBoat
This tutorial is users who want to host their own bot running FredBoat. Bear in mind that this is not a requirement for using FredBoat, as I also host a public bot. This is merely for those of you who want to host your own.

#### This tutorial is for advanced users. If you can't figure out how to run this, please use the public FredBoat

## Intallation
### Requirements
1. Java 8 JDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

2. git and maven in your PATH

3. [A registered Discord application](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

4. Linux \(Windows works too, but this tutorial is targetted Linux\)

### Instructions
Clone the `master` branch of FredBoat:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat.git
```

Now compile the bot:
```sh
cd FredBoat.git/FredBoat
mvn package shade:shade
```

To run the bot you should set up a directory that looks like this:

```
├──FredBoat-1.0.jar
├──credentials.json
└──config.json
```

The compiled bot can be found in `FredBoat.git/FredBoat/target`. A sample `config.json` and an example `credentials.json` can be found in https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/tree/master/FredBoat

In order to run the bot, you must first populate your bot with API credentials for Discord in the `credentials.json` file.

Example credentials.json file:

```txt
{
	"malPassword": null, # For the ;;mal command
	"clientToken": null, # For hosting a selfbot
	"token": {
		"beta": null,
		"production": null,
		"music": null,
		"patron": "your token here" # Your token should go here. Optionally fill the other token strings in
	},
	"googleServerKeys": [
		# Token for search. Must be hooked up to the Youtube Data API
	],
	"cbUser": null, # From https://cleverbot.io/
	"cbKey": null, # From https://cleverbot.io/
	"mashapeKey": null # Used for the ;;leet command
}
```

*Do not actually try to use a config with `#` characters in it*

Once you are done configuring, run the bot with `java -jar FredBoat-1.0.jar`, which should run the bot as if it was the patron bot.
