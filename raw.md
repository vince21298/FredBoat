### Welcome to FredBoat Docs
Welcome to the FredBoat docs. FredBoat is an open-source general-purpose bot developed in Java. The bot is based off of [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and was created by (@Frederikam). You'll be able to get a link back to this website simply by invoking `;;help`.

Additionally I am also developing FredBoat♪♪ **which is in beta** and is a music bot. This is a seperate bot and must therefore be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot). See the commands below on how to use it.

## Setting up the bot
Getting FredBoat running on your server is simple. You can invite the bot by authenticating it with your account using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=168686772216135681&scope=bot) link. Bear in mind that you must have `Manage Server` permissions to be able to do this. 

## Setting up the music bot
The music bot has it's own [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot).

## Music Commands
The music bot supports media from many sites and even supports playlists from sites like YouTube and Soundcloud. If using a playlist, please bear in mind that you cannot use a playlist with more than 30 entries. The bot will not be able to play songs blocked in the US (usually from copyright infringements on YouTube).

## Adding music to the playlist
Adding music to the playlist is pretty simple. To start playing a song, simply use the ;;play command. Here are two examples:
```
;;play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
;;play rick roll
```
You can either explicitly state the URL, or you can get the bot to search YouTube and give you some choices. Here's an example response:

```
Please select a video with the ';;select n' command:
1: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (03:33)
2: YOUTUBERS REACT TO RICKROLL (Ep. #5) (09:20)
3: I Rick Roll My Entire Chemistry Class! (05:55)
4: The New Rick Roll! (04:26)
5: Melania Trump's RNC RICKROLL (00:19)
```

You can then choose your song with the `;;select <number>` command.

**Examples of supported sites:**
* YouTube
* Soundcloud
* Google Drive
* Dropbox
* Vimeo
